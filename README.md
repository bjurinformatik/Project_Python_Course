# Creating a package for detection of loss of chromosome Y (LOY)

In this project I want to transfer R code that I use in most of my projects to a python package. The R code is used to get the percentage of Y chromosome loss in males from SNP array data. I currently run this in several steps and would like to implement these into one package to be able to run everything in one go. Another thing I would like to achieve is to optimize the speed of the modules in the package so they run in less time than it takes now in R.
